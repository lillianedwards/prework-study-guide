        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>The script to a js sheet goes under the footer and above the body elements in an HTML file becuase JS is affecting the HTML therefore it needs to load first.</li>
          <li>A string variable is a sequence of text that is enclosed in single or double quotation.</li>
          <li>A number variable is simply a number, not enclosed by anything.</li>
          <li>A Boolean variable returns a true or false response.</li>
          <li>An array variable stores multiple values in a single reference. Arrays are indexed starting at 0. Each value goes up one whole number as the amount of values in the array increases.</li>
          <li>An object variable can be anything, everything in JS is an object and can be stored as a variable.</li>
          <li>Commenting out code allows it to stay in the file but not be read by the browser, keeping it in case you need it later.</li>
          <li>Operators determine and show relationships between variables.</li>
          <li>Conditionals run tests to determine which varibles will run in the event of certain actions and which will not.</li>
          <li>Functions give pages functionality and need an arguement inside of a parantheses to enact their assigned task.</li>
          <li>Functions need a string varibale as an argument to tell the function what to display.</li>
          <li>Events are code structures that listen to activity in the browser and run code in response to that event.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is a weak typing language meaning variable are not directly associated with any particualr value type and can be assigned and re-assigned to values of all types.</li>
          <li>For a function to work it needs to be defined first and then called by name.</li>
          <li>Order matters greatly in JavaScript. The control flow is determined by the order of the code and therefore things need to be placed intentionally so that that right code loads first and can then be changed by precedding codee.</li>
          <li>The Math function in JavaScript helps generate random numbers and can be used in an array to display a random topic from a list.</li>

# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This project was created to help bootcamp students access and review information learned during Prework. 
The project was built to practice foundational coding skills in HTML, Git, CSS, and JavaScript as well as compile notes on the named topics. Students can also look back on this project once they are developing more advanced projects and see where they started. Often times when students learn something new they don't have the chance to apply it right away, this project solves that problem by giving students something to build where can also store the information they've learned along the way. 
While completing this project I learned the way in which HTML, CSS and JavaScript interact and how they can be linked together to build a functioning webpage. I also learned foundational vocabulary and best practices for each topic. Additionally I learned how to navigate GitHub and use best practices within the site to increase my comfortability with version control and future collaboration with other developers.
